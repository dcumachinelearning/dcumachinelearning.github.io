## Schedule

After some discussion, we decided to watch some videos which introduce Restricted Boltzmann Machines, and work through the mathematical derivations during the session tomorrow. The videos by Hugo Larochelle are extremely well done, and they present the concepts and the math very clearly. 

We'll watch the following three videos together, but please also watch them beforehand if you can, and feel free to continue to the later ones in the series as well:

- [Neural networks [5.1] : Restricted Boltzmann machine - definition](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4Vh_zMw-HQ)     
- [Neural networks [5.2] : Restricted Boltzmann machine - inference](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lekCh_i32iE)     
- [Neural networks [5.3] : Restricted Boltzmann machine - free energy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0Ts_7Y6hZU)      

You will need:
 - A laptop, preferably with ubuntu and the [Anaconda scientific python distribution](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) installed.
