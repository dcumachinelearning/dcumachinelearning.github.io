## When
Friday September 19, 2014 2-3:30PM

## Location
[ DCU ]( http://dcu.ie)

## Schedule

1) Read and run the code for the [Logistic Regression tutorial](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/logreg.html#logreg) and [the Multilayer Perceptron tutorial](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/mlp.html#mlp) from [deeplearning.net](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/). Note that these tutorials rely on Theano, so you should also do them to familiarize yourself with the [Theano APIs](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/), even if you totally understand LR and MLP. 

2) Read and run the code for the [Restricted Bolzmann Machines tutorial](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/rbm.html#rbm). This will be the material that we cover during the session next week. 
we'll review implementations of Feed Forward NNs in Java and Python

You will need:
 - A laptop, preferably with ubuntu and the [Anaconda scientific python distribution](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) installed.
